# Simple Ajax Chat Application
Clone the repo or download it. Create an `ajaxchat` db and run the SQL code in the *chats.sql* file on it to get the `chats` table. 

A `GET` variable called *user* is used to differentiate users to test the app. Ideally, a unique user identifier like *userId* or *username* should be obtained from the database.
